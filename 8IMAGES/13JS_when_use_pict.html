<!--There are two main purposes for the <picture> element:

1. Bandwidth
  If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file.
  The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values,
  and ignore any of the following elements.

2. Format Support
Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the <picture> element,
  you can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the first format it
  recognizes and ignore any of the following.-->
<h2>The picture Element</h2>
<picture>
  <source srcset="img_avatar.png">
  <source srcset="img_girl.jpg">
  <img src="img_beatles.gif" alt="Beatles" style="width:auto;">
</picture>

<p>The picture element can be used when the image format is not supported by all devices.</p>
<p>The device will use the first image format it supports, and ignore the rest of the images.</p>
