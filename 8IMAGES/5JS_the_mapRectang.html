<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap" width="400" height="379">
<!-- Shape
You must define the shape of the area, and you can choose one of these values:rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region, poly - defines a polygonal region, default - defines the entire region -->
<map name="workmap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
</map>
<!-- Coordinates
You must define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image.
The coordinates come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.
The coordinates 34, 44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top
The coordinates 270, 350 is located 270 pixels from the left margin and 350 pixels from the top
Now you have enough data to create a clickable rectangular area -->
